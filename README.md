nn-punk is a machine-learning project for text segmentation;
the idea being to process un-punctuated text, breaking it into
sentences (eg. speech to text).

The project currently doesn't function well (ie. at all), but feel
free to download it and work on it. :)

Included is ansi.py, for terminal colors; it includes support,
documented in ansi.py, for colorizing text. I use it for visualizing
the weights.
